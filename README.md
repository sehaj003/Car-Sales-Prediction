# Car Sales Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting car sales using historical sales data. The dataset includes various factors such as date, product type, store location, and sales revenue. By conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and leveraging machine learning models, we aim to uncover trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data to accurately forecast future sales.

## Dataset
The sales prediction dataset is sourced from Kaggle and comprises historical data on sales transactions. Key features include:
* Country
* Gender
* Age
* Annual Salary
* Credit-Card-Debt
* Net worth
* Car purchase amount
*LINK to DATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohdshahnawazaadil/sales-prediction-dataset/data*

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyze the distribution of sales over time.
* Explore the relationship between different features and sales revenue.
* Identify trends and seasonal patterns in the data.
* Visualize the data using various plots and charts.

## Model Building
* Preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Implement various machine learning models, such as *Linear Regression*, *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* and *Random Forest*
* Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
* Select the best-performing model for sales prediction.
